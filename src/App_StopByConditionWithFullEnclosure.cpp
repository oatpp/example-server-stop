/**
 * This example shows how to keep Oat++ entirely in its own thread and let it stop by a check condition. This might be
 * a more straight forward solution compared to calling `server->stop()`.
 * Some may encounter the situation where the whole Oat++ runtime AND environment should be enclosed in a single thread
 * and its stack. A "full enclosure".
 * WARNING: This also encapsulates the Oat++ environment in the thread. Thus other Oat++ mechanisms like logging is only
 * available while the thread is running. However, you should NOT rely on using Oat++ environment mechanisms outside
 * of the Oat++ part of your project. If you still want to use Oat++ Logging and other Oat++ functions, call the
 * environments init and destroy in main or their respective scope.
